# EDA-_cereals
Exploratory data analysis project

For practicing EDA in both Python and R. I've used two data sets, one on cereals (nutrional valuesa) and other on training data (employees income, age, education, etc.) 

The purpose of training project in R is to demonstrate why we don't recommend deleting any outliers during the EDA stage. The reason we don't do this is because it changes the nature of our data set.
